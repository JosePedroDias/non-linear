We decided to adapt the [Fighting Fantasy](https://www.fightingfantasy.com/) book
[The Warlock of Firetop Mountain](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fighting-Fantasy-Warlock-Firetop-Mountain/dp/1407181300)

- [play the game](https://josepedrodias.github.io/non-linear/)
- [see the adventure graph](https://josepedrodias.github.io/non-linear/graph.html)

## small history of how it rolled out

- we decided on doing this as these books were part of our childhood and are a good example of an interactive narrative
- we chose this book as it is the first one and popular
- we found the book in PDF and a word version - we used the former as reference and the 2nd to extract the text and images
- we started to manually parse the narrative into 400 sections with different interaction modes to fill in
